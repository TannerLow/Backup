# Backup
Creates a backup folder of a selected folder.

---

The program will ask for a source folder and will copy it to \\Documents\\Backups on the current user that is logged in.  
For example 

"Documents\\Projects" will copy the folder C:\\Users\\\<username\>\\Documents\\Projects 

to C:\\Users\\\<username\>\\Documents\\Backups\\

The files being copied over will be put in their own folder called "Backup YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS"  
to prevent the mixing of files as well as timestamp the backup.
